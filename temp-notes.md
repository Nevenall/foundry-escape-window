need to update for foundry 13

default behavior is to minimize windows
but there's someone who'd like the option to disable the escape key affecting open windows at all because they get their windows all setup and even minimizing them is kind of annoying

Though, I thought hitting escape again would maximum the windows again in the same spot (should check that)

but we can add a config to change the window closing behavior to shift+escape rather then escape. Though, I'm not sure if that's a thing that's possible given keybinding
